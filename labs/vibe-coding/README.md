### What is Vibe Coding?

> "There's a new kind of coding I call 'vibe coding', where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists."  
> — **Andrej Karpathy**, February 2025

Vibe coding is the practice of instructing AI to write code via natural language, accepting the output without deep review, and iterating rapidly based on the "vibe" or high-level intent.

### What happened next

Karpathy coined the term in early 2025 as a description of a mode he was
enjoying, not a recommendation for production. The industry adopted it
anyway, and by 2026 there is data on what that costs:

| | |
|---|---|
| US developers using AI coding tools daily | **92%** |
| …who say they trust the output | **29%** |
| …who always review it before committing | **48%** |
| Major issues vs human-written code | **1.7×** |
| AI-generated samples with an OWASP Top-10 vulnerability | **~45%** |
| Sprint capacity spent on AI-traceable bugs by day 90 | **20–30%** |

Two vocabulary terms came out of that experience, and both are useful:

- **Comprehension debt** — the future cost of understanding, modifying and
  debugging code a machine wrote and nobody read. Like technical debt, but
  the thing you borrowed against is *understanding*.
- **Haunted codebase** — a working system the team no longer understands.
  It runs. Nobody is confident changing it.

*(Treat the exact percentages as indicative — they come from industry
surveys of varying rigour. The direction is not in dispute.)*

### The counter-trend: spec-driven development

The reaction to vibe coding is **spec-driven development (SDD)**: instead
of prompting your way to code and hoping, you write a **specification**
first, let the agent produce a plan and tasks from it, and only then
implement. Tooling grew up around this fast — GitHub Spec Kit, AWS Kiro,
and the skills/plan systems in agentic CLIs.

    Vibe coding:        intent → code → hope
    Spec-driven:        intent → spec → plan → tasks → code → check against spec

The spec becomes the artefact you review, and it is far easier to review
one page of intent than 800 lines of generated implementation.

**It is not free.** A common objection from practitioners is that you can
end up reviewing a pile of markdown instead of reviewing code — ceremony
that feels like rigour without being it. The judgement is knowing which
mode a task deserves.

| | Vibe coding suits | Spec-driven suits |
|---|---|---|
| Stakes | Prototype, throwaway, demo | Production, shared, long-lived |
| Requirements | Discovering them as you go | Known well enough to write down |
| Cost of being wrong | Delete it and retry | Someone maintains this for years |
| Review unit | The running app | The spec, then the tests |

**Keep this tension in mind for the whole lab.** You are about to build
the same app three times by vibe coding. Pay attention to what you would
*not* be willing to ship, and why.

## 5. 🎯 The Challenge: Build a To-Do App

Now that you've set up all three tools, it's time to build the **same application** using each one. This will allow you to compare the vibe coding experience across platforms.

### The Application Requirements

Build a simple **To-Do List Application** with the following features:

1. **Add a task** with a title
2. **Mark a task as complete**
3. **Delete a task**
4. **Display all tasks** in a list

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[To-Do App] --> B[Add Task]
    A --> C[Mark Complete]
    A --> D[Delete Task]
    A --> E[Display List]
```

### Your Prompts

Use the following prompts (or similar) with each tool:

**Initial Prompt:**
> "Create a simple to-do list application. Users should be able to add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them. Display all tasks in a clean list format."

**Refinement Prompts** (use as needed):
> "Add a checkbox next to each task to mark it complete"

> "Add a delete button for each task"

> "Make completed tasks appear with a strikethrough"

> "Add a count of remaining tasks at the bottom"

---

### Task 5.1: Build with Google Antigravity

1. Create a new project in Antigravity.
2. Use the Agent Manager to describe your to-do app.
3. Let the AI generate the code.
4. Review the Artifacts and approve/refine.
5. Test the application.
6. **Experiment!** Try adding extra features like due dates or priority levels.

---

### Task 5.2: Build with Bolt.new

1. Open Bolt.new in your browser and start a new app.
2. Describe your to-do app in natural language.
3. Watch the live preview update and review the generated code.
4. Refine with additional prompts.
5. Test the functionality.
6. **Experiment!** Try enabling the built-in deploy and sharing the link.

---

### Task 5.3: Build with Firebase Studio

1. Create a new project in Firebase Studio.
2. Use the prompt interface to describe your to-do app.
3. Let the AI generate the UI and data structure.
4. Refine and connect data.
5. Test the application.
6. **Experiment!** Try asking it to add user authentication or cloud sync.

### Task 5.4: Read what you shipped

You have three working applications you did not write. Pick **one** and
spend 15 minutes finding out what is actually in it.

1. Open the generated source. Find the file that handles **user input**
   or **data storage**.
2. Answer these in `REFLECTION.md`:
   - How many dependencies did it add? Do you know what any of them do?
   - Is user input validated anywhere before it is stored or displayed?
   - If this app stored real people's data, what would worry you?
   - Find **one** line you genuinely cannot explain. Paste it. Now ask
     the AI to explain it — did the explanation match what you assumed?
3. Ask your AI assistant directly: *"Review this code for security
   vulnerabilities as a security engineer would."* Record what it finds.

**Expected outcome:** you find at least one thing you would not have
shipped. Roughly 45% of AI-generated code samples carry an OWASP Top-10
vulnerability, so the base rate is on your side — and unvalidated input
is the usual suspect.

This is comprehension debt made concrete: the app works, you own it, and
until this exercise you had no idea what was in it.

### Task 5.5: The same app, spec-first

Now do it the other way, once, to feel the difference.

1. **Before prompting anything**, write a one-page spec in
   `spec.md`: what the app does, what it explicitly does *not* do, the
   data it stores, and three acceptance criteria you could test.
2. Give the spec to an AI coding assistant and ask it to produce a
   **plan** first — not code.
3. Review the plan against your spec. Correct it.
4. Only then let it implement.

Record in `REFLECTION.md`:

```
## Vibe vs spec-driven

Time, vibe coding: ......... [minutes]
Time, spec-driven: ......... [minutes]
Which produced code you'd defend? .......... [which, and why]
Which would you use for a throwaway prototype? ...... [which]
Which for the module project (60% of your grade)? ... [which]
Where did writing the spec change what you built? ... [be specific]
```

There is no expected answer. Spec-driven is slower and that cost is real;
the question is what it buys and when the purchase is worth making.

## 8. 🤖 Vibe Coding Best Practices

### The Vibe Coding Workflow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[1. Describe Goal] --> B[2. AI Generates Code]
    B --> C[3. Execute & Observe]
    C --> D{Works?}
    D -->|No| E[4. Refine Prompt]
    E --> B
    D -->|Yes| F[5. Deploy/Submit]
```

### Do's and Don'ts

**DO:**
- Start with clear, high-level descriptions
- Iterate in small steps
- Test frequently
- Document what works and what doesn't
- Be specific when refining

**DON'T:**
- Accept code blindly for production use
- Ignore security considerations
- Skip testing because "it looks right"
- Forget to understand what the code does
- Use vibe coding for safety-critical applications

### Effective Prompting Tips

1. **Be Specific**: "Add a red delete button on the right side of each task" is better than "add delete"
2. **Provide Context**: "This is for a mobile-first web app" helps the AI make appropriate choices
3. **Describe Behaviour**: Focus on what the app should DO, not how to code it
4. **Iterate Incrementally**: Add features one at a time rather than all at once

## 9. 🎓 Academic Integrity

### Remember

- **Vibe coding is about learning**, not just getting output
- **Understand what you submit** — you may be asked to explain your application
- **Document your process** — the journey is as important as the destination
- AI tools are **learning aids**, not replacements for understanding
- **Follow ATU's academic integrity policies** at all times

### What You're Learning

This lab teaches you to:
- Evaluate and compare AI development tools
- Think critically about AI-generated code
- Understand the trade-offs of different development approaches
- Develop skills in prompt engineering
- Reflect on the future of software development
